In other words, the $j$-th neuron of the $i$-th layer: $x_{i,j}$ computes $\\max(\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} x_{i-1,k} \\times w_{i,j,k} + b_{i,j}, 0)$, where $N=256$ for $i=1$ and $N=16$ for $i=2$ & 3.\n\nThe output layer has 10 nodes, each of which represents a digit (i.e. 0, 1, 2, ..., 9). The $j$-th output node $x_{4,j}$ computes $\\sum_{k=0}^{15} x_{3,k} \\times w_{4,j,k} + b_{4,j}$, without ReLU. The output with the maximum value will be the inference result.\n\n\n(b) How many weights and biases are needed respectively to compute the outputs of the neural network shown above for one 16*16 image?",
